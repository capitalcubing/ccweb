# Code Guidelines

## Modularity
1. Please try to keep your code organized and modular.
2. Please think about removing redundancy. If you have to make change in 10 files to have same change on 10 pages, something is probably wrong.
3. Keep images and css in separate directories. For css related to a specific file, have a separate code and don't overload the default style.css that applies to whole website.


## Consistency
1. Names images, and ideally even classes and functions to something sensible.
2. Comment your code. On anything non-trivial, a one line comment before every section describing what it does will be good
3. Indent your code somewhat reasonably and uniformly.
4. Good design is mobile-first. If you don't write the mobile version separately, make sure that whatever you have designed performs as intended on squeezing the screen. In chrome, you can turn on chrome developer tools to see this effect better.

## Collaboration
1. At any moment, make sure that nobody else is working on the same file as you are on the master branch. If someone is, please discuss with the person to avoid issues later.
2. Work as a team. Try to listen to inputs by everyone

## Learning
1. Please try to take this opportunity to learn something rather than just writing stuff that makes the website work.
2. You can choose to work on a specific skill - Be it CSS, JS, UX, UI, Colors, Graphic Design, etc. 
3. You can document resources you have read below so others can refer. No need to document official documentation but something special that you did. But having good links handy will help everyone.
