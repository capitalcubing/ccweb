###<a name="home-desc">1. Home</a>
The homepage will have only a few buttons(less than 10) which will be the broadcast categories we can make. The current design is a tesselation of rhombi (which is a projected view of a cube) . <br>
Heading Font = Strasua <br>
Tagline Font = Any (e.g. Century Gothic) <br>
The proposed design of Home page looks as below
![Home Design](images/homedesign.png)
On mouse hover, it changes icons to text description
![Hover](images/hover.png)
On mouse click, it splits in a sequence as below, to now <b> show subcategories instead of original categories </b> . We can insert as much depth we want this way.
